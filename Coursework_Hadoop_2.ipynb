I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿\n",
