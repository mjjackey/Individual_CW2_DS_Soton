    "This coursework will assess your understanding of using NoSQL to store and retrieve data.  You will perform operations on data from the Enron email dataset in a MongoDB database, and write a report detailing the suitability of different types of databases for data science applications.  You will be required to run code to answer the given questions in the Jupyter notebook provided, and write a report describing alternative approaches to using MongoDB.\n",

You do not need to set up any authentication.  In the Jupyter notebook provided, perform the following tasks, using the Python PyMongo library.\n",

The tourney \\nstarts at 10 and is 3 hours long.  If we win, we get 16 tickets to the game \\n(2 for each of us).  Let me know if you are interested.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nEric\\nx3-0977\\n\\n\\nFrom: Paul Burkhart@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 11/14/2000 05:51 PM\\nTo: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRON\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Re: Plays and other information  \\n\\nHope all is well.  Is this in reference to the Enron/Andersen Consulting \\nfootball game?  When is it?  Do you need me to play?

There are plays on both tabs.\\nI was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at \\ncenter, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at \\nblocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have \\nobjections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that \\nhe will play (P.

Over 2billion people have access to the Internet, including youtube, and  the numbers are rising, by 2017 half of the populatoin will be connected. 3. Hackers In Korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion  hits to make it more popular.  4. The song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been  seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing  those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5.
